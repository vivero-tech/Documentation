[Tendermint] in Rust with [TLA+ specifications](/docs/spec).

Tendermint is a high-performance blockchain consensus engine for Byzantine fault
tolerant applications written in any programming language.

## Tendermint Core Compatibility

tendermint-rs has been tested for compatibility with Tendermint Core v0.34.21.

## Requirements

Tested against the latest stable version of Rust. May work with older versions.

### Semantic Versioning

We do our best to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). However, as
we are pre-v1.0.0, we use the MINOR version to refer to breaking changes and the
PATCH version for features, improvements, and fixes.

We use the same version for all crates and release them collectively.

## Documentation

See each component for the relevant documentation.

Libraries:

- [tendermint](./tendermint) - Tendermint data structures and serialization
- [tendermint-abci](./abci) - A lightweight, low-level framework for building
  Tendermint ABCI applications in Rust
- [tendermint-light-client](./light-client) - Tendermint light client library
  for verifying signed headers and tracking validator set changes
- [tendermint-light-client-detector](./light-client-detector) - Library for
  detecting and reporting attacks against the Tendermint light client
- [tendermint-light-client-cli](./light-client-cli) - CLI for the light client,
  for verifying headers, detecting attacks and reporting them.
- [tendermint-light-client-js](./light-client-js) - Low-level WASM interface for
  interacting with the Tendermint light client verification functionality
- [tendermint-p2p](./p2p) - At present this primarily provides the ability to
  connect to Tendermint nodes via Tendermint's [secret connection](tendermint-secret-conn)
- [tendermint-proto](./proto) - Protobuf data structures (generated using Prost)
  for wire-level interaction with Tendermint
- [tendermint-rpc](./rpc) - Tendermint RPC client and response types
